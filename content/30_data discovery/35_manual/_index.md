# Manual declaration
This module will help you to understand the broad capabilities of SmallID to connect to various datasources.
We will explore how to connect to a specific RDS instance running a MySQL engine. The same setup can be executed to connect to on-prem databases or for specific connectors that cannot be autodiscovered.

This section will make you navigate through the list of possible connectors and will help you configure a RDS mysql database with credentials stored in Secret Manager
