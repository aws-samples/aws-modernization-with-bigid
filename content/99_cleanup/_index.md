- Navigate to AWS Codebuild service, section [build projects](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?region=us-east-1)
- Select the project prefixed with SelfDestroy and click on Start build -> Start now. The process will take a couple of minutes and delete all resources deployed for the devday session.
